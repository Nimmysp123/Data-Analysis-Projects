# Netflix Analysis with Jupyter Notebook


## Project Overview

The Netflix Analysis with Jupyter Notebook is a comprehensive exploration of Netflix content, utilizing Python and Jupyter Notebook for data cleaning, preprocessing, and detailed analysis. This project delves into the Netflix dataset to extract meaningful insights and presents them through interactive visualizations.

## Data Preparation & Refinement

Methodically navigating through the dataset, we executed data cleaning protocols, visualized null values, and handled them to ensure data integrity and precision. Further, we split and transformed columns related to movie durations and TV show seasons into distinct, insightful DataFrames.

## Exploratory Analysis & Visualization

### Key Visual Insights:

- **Top Actors & Directors:** Utilized Dot and Dumbbell representation to uncover the most influential actors and directors within the dataset, offering insights into their prolific contributions.
  
- **Most Watched Duration:** Graphical representation to reveal viewer preferences in duration, highlighting patterns in the most watched durations across movies and TV shows.

- **Top Movie Production Countries:** Map representation showcasing the countries contributing significantly to movie production, providing a global perspective on film industry dynamics.
